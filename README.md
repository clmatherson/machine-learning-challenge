Machine Learning Challenge

Of the models I created, model 1 LogisticRegression was the model I chose as the best.

LogisticRegression was selected because we needed to determine if exoplanets could be confirmed as a planet.

The classification report for Model 1 shows:
Weighted Average Precision of 87%. This means the model will classify the correct class 87% of the time (i.e. it is very precise)
The recall Score shows that the model guessed correctly 69% of the time. Although this is far from perfect, it is more than satisfactory.

An f1-score of 90% results in a harmonic mean that shows high accuracy between precision & recall. This is important in a well-balanced model.
