Machine Learning Challenge

Of the models created; Model 3 shows the best results.

The classification report for Model 3 shows:
Weighted Average Precision of 89%. This means the model will classify the correct class 89% of the time.
Although this is not perfect, it is more than satisfactory given the provided data.

An f1-score of 87% results in a harmonic mean that shows high accuracy between precision & recall

This is good, because the support shows the dataset is not balanced (i.e. 52% of the occurrence is Confirmed planets)
